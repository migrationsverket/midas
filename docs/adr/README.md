## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

We use a simple format:
- **Number**: Sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Status**: Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The problem or situation
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What this means going forward
